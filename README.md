# Page View Time Series Visualizer

### Summary
This is my submission for the freecodecamp Medical Data Visualizer project under the ***"Data Analysis with Python"*** certification program. A link to the project page can be found [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/page-view-time-series-visualizer).

### Goal
The goal of this project is to visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. I will use ```pandas```, ```matplotlib```, and ```seaborn``` to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03.
